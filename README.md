# Programming Language Recommendation System

## Overview

This repository hosts a programming language recommendation system, designed as an expert system to suggest programming languages based on user-selected characteristics via a questionnaire form.

### System Description

The system functions as an expert system that recommends programming languages based on user-defined characteristics through a questionnaire. It was developed using Prolog for knowledge base creation and Python for other components.

### Technologies and Libraries Used

- **Prolog:**
  - Utilized for constructing the knowledge base to facilitate language recommendations.

- **Python:**
  - Employed for integrating various system components and managing user interactions.

### Libraries:

- **PyQT5:**
  - Implemented for creating the user interface, ensuring an intuitive experience for users interacting with the system.

- **PySWIP:**
  - Used to establish a connection between Python and Prolog for seamless integration and data exchange.

### Note:

- The source files are available, but the executable is not provided.
- Installation of required libraries is necessary before executing the code.

## Usage Instructions

To run the system, follow these steps:

1. **Install Required Libraries:**
   - Ensure that PyQT5 and PySWIP libraries are installed in your Python environment.

2. **Execution:**
   - Run the main Python file to launch the interface for the language recommendation system.

## Notes for Users

It's essential to install the necessary libraries before executing the code to ensure the proper functioning of the system.
